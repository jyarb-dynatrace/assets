This makes the demo feel a bit more \"real\" and less scripted.\n\n##### Quick analysis in Notebooks and Dashboards\n* **Test all examples in advance** to make sure that the expected data is actually available in the environment, within the expected timeframe. \n* If you're doing a demo in a customer environment, prepare some examples that will **query their own 'custom' data** (e.g. custom metrics, business data). Note: environment-aware queries must be enabled for this to work.\n* If your customer is concerned about the cost of auto-executing queries, highlight the fact that you can now \"Generate DQL only\" without the execution step. \n\n##### Quick answers in conversational interface [PREVIEW]\n* **Test all examples in advance** to make sure that the Davis CoPilot returns the expected result\n* If your customer recently had an interesting question – see if Davis CoPilot can answer this on the spot. \n* Don't expect the conversational interface to generate accurate DQL – only the integration in Notebooks and Dashboards has been optimized to generate DQL.\n\n##### Have more questions?\nIf you have any questions, please refer to this [internal FAQ doc](https://dynatrace.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/RnD/EczxV83HHo9OgHpie-W3laUBuwTQ8iSqSq7YFJr8xGUbAg?e=AiCodI).
